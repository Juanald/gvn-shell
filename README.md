# Introducing gvn, the ultimate C shell
This is a shell I wrote on my free time, with a little help from [https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

# Capabilities
Implements basic UNIX commands, like ls and cat for multiple arguments. Only works on Windows due to my usage of the Windows API. Looking to implement more UNIX commands
like grep, as well as options for each command.
